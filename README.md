# CS-Java-Projects
My CS Projects at UMD in Java
The first Project is a simple Hello world. 
The second project (Orioles Baseball) involves the use of basic if, else, else-if loops.  
The third Project (Flags of the world) involves the manipulation of the grid and colors with for loops to create 9 flags of countries from around the world. 
The fourth Project (Medieval Soldiers) involves writing java code that defines the behaviour of a soldier. The project is a grid where soldiers from red and blue team fight.
